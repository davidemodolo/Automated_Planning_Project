; NOTE
; esecuzione di task in parallelo non ne vedo... si pu√≤ pensare di farlo se si hanno
; due robot che lavorano contemporaneamente...
; In general, the parallel execution of actions is possible when they involve different entities 
; (robotic agents, carriers, boxes, etc.) and there's no overlap in the preconditions and effects of the actions.

; NOTE DI RIMOZIONE
; tolto equality per vedere se era quello il problema, da riprovare
; non supporta either, cambio con estensione 
; non supporta il formato suggerito dall extension PDDL, bisogna scrivere le conditions una alla volta con at start at and ecc....
